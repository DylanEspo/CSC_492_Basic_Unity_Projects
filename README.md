  Make sure when downloading the executables folder you download the UnityPlayer.dll as well the data folder corresponding to the application. This dll file allows the application to launch within your personal computer. The data folder holds all the relavent information that builds and creates the game. Keep all three of these within the same hierarchy and the application should launch. 

  For example...if you want to play the Katamari Clone application you would download the Katamari Clone Application, the Katamari Clone    Data folder, and finally the UnityPlayer.dll file. You can share the UnityPlayer.dll among all the other projects, it should work correctly.

  A potential alternative is to download the project code, launch in unity and create an executable build. Includes only some of the early Unity projects that I worked on.
