Make sure when downloading the executables folder you download the UnityPlayer.dll as well the data folder corresponding to the application(For example if you want to play the Katamari Clone application you would download the Katamari Clone Application, the Katamari Clone Data folder, and finally the UnityPlayer.dll file.) You can share the UnityPlayer.dll among all the other projects, it should work correctly.

This dll file allows the application to launch within your personal computer. Keep both the application and the UnityPlayer within the same hierarchy and the application should launch. 

A potential alternative is to download the project code, launch in unity and create an executable build. Includes only some of the early Unity projects that I worked on.
