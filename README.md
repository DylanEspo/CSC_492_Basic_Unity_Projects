Make sure when downloading the executables folder you download the UnityPlayer.dll. This dll file allows the application to launch within your personal computer. Keep both the application and the UnityPlayer within the same hierarchy and the application should launch. 

A potential alternative is to download the project code, launch in unity and create an executable build. Includes only some of the early Unity projects that I worked on.
